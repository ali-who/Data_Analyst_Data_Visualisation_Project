## Project Overview
This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process.

In Part I, Exploratory data visualization, you will use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.
In Part II, Explanatory data visualization, you will produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset. The primary method of conveying your findings will be through transforming your exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.


## Why this project?
Data visualization is an important skill that is used in many parts of the data analysis process.

Exploratory data visualization generally occurs during and after the data wrangling process, and is the main method that you will use to understand the patterns and relationships present in your data. This understanding will help you approach any statistical analyses and will help you build conclusions and findings. This process might also illuminate additional data cleaning tasks to be performed.
Explanatory data visualization techniques are used after generating your findings, and are used to help communicate your results to others. Understanding design considerations will make sure that your message is clear and effective. In addition to being a good producer of visualizations, going through this project will also help you be a good consumer of visualizations that are presented to you by others.
What will I learn?


## What I learnt from this project:

Supplement statistics with visualizations to build understanding of data.
Choose appropriate plots, limits, transformations, and aesthetics to explore a dataset, allowing you to understand distributions of variables and relationships between features.
Use design principles to create effective visualizations for communicating findings to an audience.


## Dataset

The dataset name is "Airline On-Time Performance Data". This dataset reports flights in the United States, including carriers, arrival and departure delays, and reasons for delays, from 2007 to 2008.


## Summary of Findings

Febuary was the month with the most cancellaitons
Atalanta was the airport with the most cancellations
Saturday was the day where the least flights occured
Envoy Air and American Airlines were the airlines who most often cancelled their flights
Summer and fall have increased flight delay times compared to the winter and spring months.


## Key Insights for Presentation

The month of september had the longest mean security delays across the year.
Carrier cancellations were the most common reason why flights were cancelled and MQ(Envoy Air), AA(American Airlines) were the main airlines who cancelled their flights.
